                    <p>As the importance of data and the cloud continues to grow by the day, it is only natural that innovations in
                        data-storage should be sought. Combining the concept of the cloud with blockchain technology it is possible to
                        create an endless platform for the permanent storage of data.</p>
                    <img class="docImg" src="./img/vision.png">
                    <span class="fig">Electrical system symbol for a battery; storage devices with potentialliy limitless potential.</span>
                    <p>It is this combination, brought about in a manner that remains secure under any cryptographic or cryptonomic
                        assumptions, that can allow for the existence of data beyond the centralised control of any single entity.</p>

                    <p>ZingZap is completely decentralised. While this site serves as a UI to access the blockchain, all the work is done by
                        your computer. Choosing any random 256-bit string as your password, your computer will hash this string 16384 times
                        to produce a new
                        address. This address can be used to verify your identity and validate any signatures you publish.</p>
                    <p>If you want to upload data to the chain in the form of a transaction you will send through the
                        16383-<b>i</b><sup>th</sup> hash of your password as a signature, where <b>i</b> is the number of transactions you
                        have sent before. No one except the owner of the password can achieve this (not even us), but others are able to use this
                        signature to verify it was truly you that sent it.</p>
                    <img class="docImg" src="./img/cryptographic.JPG">
                    <span class="fig">Hashing involves taking some input and producing an output that cannot be replicated by anyone except the owner of the input.</span>
                    <p>By creating signatures in this manner data can be uploaded significantly faster than with traditional methods, and
                        the data remains secure even when quantum computers come about. However, once you have sent 16383 transactions your
                        account becomes 'expired' and a new one must be created. This won't have too much impact though, as all data ever
                        uploaded (even by 'expired' account) remains in permanent storage for all to access.</p>
                    <p>As long as there exists one computer in the world running the ZingZap blockchain, all data contained within it will
                        remain in existence in a manner that can never be censored, removed, or changed. If you are uploading private data
                        it is important that you encrypt it prior to uploading.</p>

                    <p>Existing as the settlement layer for the blockchain ecosystem, ZingZap serves as a single point of truth for any to rely on.</p>
                    <p>To guarantee that no one can manipulate the system to their favour each individual is provided a fraction of the total governance tokens and a fixed number of staking tokens upon committing funds to ZingZap.</p>
                    <p>Governance tokens are handed out at a formulaic ratio so that no one can control the network without losing significant investment and data. Staking tokens are provided to define exactly how much data any one user can store.</p>
